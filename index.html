---

I‚Äôm a software engineer based in San Antonio, Texas, motivated by a genuine desire to be useful‚Äîstarting with my family and extending to my community, my country, and the planet. My journey began with a practical decision to join the military at a young age, which taught me the importance of being a team player and staying adaptable. After my service, I transitioned into tech by completing a full-stack web development bootcamp, which led me to my first role as a software engineer. I‚Äôve been building on that foundation ever since, driven by the work itself and the impact it can have.

Technically, I work mainly with C# in a .NET environment, focusing on backend development, code reviews, and managing Jenkins pipelines to ensure smooth deployments. I enjoy being hands-on, working closely with my team through SCRUM processes like sprint planning and stand-ups. On the web development side, I‚Äôm comfortable building custom sites or using open-source tools to create functional solutions quickly. My strengths lie in communication and adaptability, allowing me to contribute effectively and stay versatile across different projects.

Looking forward, I‚Äôm committed to continuous growth‚Äînot just for my own advancement, but to make tangible contributions that matter. My goals are centered on finding solutions that genuinely progress humanity, whether that‚Äôs through innovative software or larger efforts like sustainable energy systems. I‚Äôm focused on evolving within the industry and taking on leadership roles where I can make a real difference. I‚Äôm more approachable than I might seem, so feel free to DM me‚ÄîI‚Äôm always open to connecting and learning from others.`;
